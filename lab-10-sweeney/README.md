## Submission Instructions

* Push to your repository
* Submit a pull request to this repository

## Feature Tasks
Make the tests pass. All the tests start being written with `test.skip` so your
test result output isn't overwhelming. Remove `.skip` for tests one-by-one as
you implement more and more methods.

Implement the empty methods in the `lib/linked-list.js` file according to how
the tests are grouped. Here are the following mandatory test groups you must
make pass:

* new ListNode should create a node
* O(1) Methods
* O(N) Methods
* Convenience Methods

## Stretch Goals
Implement any methods in the test groups labeled "Stretch Goal:"

* Stretch Goal: create getNthFromLast convenience methods (hard difficulty)
* Stretch Goal: Common Interview Questions
* Stretch Goal: Functional Methods
